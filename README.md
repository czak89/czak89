* 🎨 **ComfyUI:** Generating realistic images of Chuck Norris... or maybe just better logos.
* 🖥️ **Windows Mods:** Because system stability is for people who don't embrace existential dread.

* I should probably be doing something else right now.
* If it works, touch it. Until it doesn't. No backups YOLO"
